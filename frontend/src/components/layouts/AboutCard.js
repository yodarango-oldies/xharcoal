				{`Hello, My name is Daniel R. and I am a passionate web developer who loves to code. I am the person behind the curtains of this and many other websites and web apps. 
                I graduated with a degree in cyber security in 2019 but decided to dive into the software development and Graphic design world shortly after. Upon a couple years of working for a company and 
                creating projects for personal use I decided to offer my services to clients and open my small start up company, Xharcoal. 
                
                My main goal is to make of Xharcoal a big, reputable, and successful enterprise. Do you need a website, graphic design, or web app? Let me do that for you! ðŸ˜‰`}
